        A couple of examples (the

        (optional) The configuration to use. By default your Scheme
        defines which configuration (Debug, Release, ...) should be used,
        but you can overwrite it with this option.

        **Make sure that the Configuration you specify actually exists
        in your Xcode Project**. If it does not, if you have a typo
        in the value of this input Xcode will simply use the Configuration
        specified by the Scheme and will silently ignore this parameter!

        This output will include the main target app's path + every dependent target's app path.


        The paths are separated with `|` character, eg: `/deploy109787178/sample-apps-ios-workspace-swift.app|/deploy109787178/bitfall.sample-apps-ios-workspace-swift-watch.app`
  - BITRISE_XCODE_BUILD_RAW_RESULT_TEXT_PATH:
    opts:
      title: The full, raw build output file path
      description: |-
        This is the path of the raw build results log file.

        If `output_tool=xcpretty` and the build fails this log will contain the build output.
