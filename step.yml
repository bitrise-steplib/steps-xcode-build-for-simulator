title: Xcode Build for Simulator
summary: Runs `xcodebuild` commands for simulators
description: |
  This Step runs the `xcodebuild` command to build and deploy an app to an iOS, tvOS, or watchOS simulator. You can use this to perform quick tests of your app, or to show it off in a browser to your clients.

  The Step generates the following outputs:

  - `BITRISE_APP_DIR_PATH`: The path to the generated `.app` file.
  - `BITRISE_APP_DIR_PATH_LIST`: The path to the generated `.app` file, and the paths to every dependent target app.
    (Paths are separated by the `|` (pipe) character.)
  - `BITRISE_XCODE_BUILD_RAW_RESULT_TEXT_PATH`: The path to the raw log file for the build.

  The Step also creates an `.xctestrun` file which you can use to run tests.

  Make sure to include this Step after the Steps that install the necessary dependencies — such as _Run Cocoapods Install_ — in your Workflow.

  ### Configuring the Step

  Minimum configuration:

  1. In the **Project path** input, enter the path to your Xcode Project or Workspace.
    (Only necessary if you plan to use a different scheme than the one set in the `BITRISE_PROJECT_PATH` Environment Variable.)
  1. In the **Scheme** input, enter the name of the Scheme you'd like to use for building your project.
    (Only necessary if you plan to use a different scheme than the one set in the `BITRISE_SCHEME` Environment Variable.)

  For more configuration options, see the descriptions of other inputs in the `step.yml` or in the Workflow Editor.

      Set this exactly as it appears in the device selection menu in Xcode's device selection UI.

      A couple of examples (the actual available options depend on which versions are installed):

      * iPhone 8 Plus
      * iPhone Xs Max
      * iPad Air (3rd generation)
      * iPad Pro (12.9-inch) (3rd generation)
      * Apple TV 4K

      Don't forget to set the platform to `tvOS Simulator` in order to use an Apple TV simulator.

  opts:
    title: Configuration name
    summary: The name of the Xcode Configuration to use when building
    description: |-
      (Optional) The name of the Xcode Configuration to use (Debug, Release, etc.). By default your Scheme's archive action defines which Configuration should be used, but this can be overridden it with this option.

      **If the Configuration specified in this input does not exist in your project, the Step will silently ignore the value, and fall back to using the Configuration specified in the Scheme.**
- disable_index_while_building: "yes"
  opts:
    title: Disable indexing during the build
    summary: This may speed up builds by skipping indexing while building.
    description: |-
      When this input is enabled, `COMPILER_INDEX_STORE_ENABLE=NO` is added to the `xcodebuild` command, which disables indexing while building. Disabling this could speed up your builds by eliminating a (normally) unnecessary step.

      Indexing is useful for certain editor features — like autocompletion, jump to definition, and code information lookup — but these features are generally not necessary in a CI environment.
    value_options:
    - "yes"
    - "no"
- code_signing_allowed: "no"
  opts:
    title: Code signing allowed
    summary: Whether or not to allow code signing for this build
    description: |-
      When building an app for the simulator, code signing is not required and is set to "no" by default.

      On rare occasions, you may need to set the flag to "yes" — usually when working with certain test cases or third-party dependencies.

      - `xcpretty`: The xcodebuild command's output will be prettified by xcpretty.
      - `xcodebuild`: Only the last 20 lines of raw xcodebuild output will be visible in the build log.

      The raw xcodebuild log will be exported in both cases.

      This is the path to the raw build results log file.

      If `output_tool` is set to `xcpretty` and the build fails, this log will contain the build output.
